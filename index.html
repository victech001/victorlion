    <p>My name is Nnamani Victor Chinonso. I am <em>passionate</em> about tech and would want to go far.
    </p>

    <p>I always want to do great thing in tech but i had so many challenges that drew me back in my vision of pursuit of learning tech.</p>

    <h3>MY CHALLENGES</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Laptop</li>
        <li>Less family support</li>
        <li>how to start</li>
        <li>finance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>During my NYSC i bought a laptop and then started watching youtube videos, after i have asked few friends where to start, cos starting was a very big challenge... then a friend of mine told me to start with <strong>FRONT END DEVELOPMENT.</strong> I started tutorial with freecodecamp, i was happy that i can do something, i was happy that my dream is coming to reality.</p>

    <p>Then a friend of mine told me about the Peter Mbahs Tech programme. I was lucky enough to be selected.. Tho it has not been easy but God is seeing me through, combining work with learning, it wasn't easy but with a wonderful tutor like <em>Ms. Adaeze,</em> learing have been superb, and i know i'm going far.</p>
